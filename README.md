# UniversityRegistrationSystem
## Main idea
The problem to be solved in this project is to design a university registration 
system which requires a database of the student’s data this data is the used to perform different functions on it. The tasks that a registration system can do from the student’s data are uncountable. Mainly in this project I will try to perform tasks such as: allow the student to access the data and configure it only by entering the correct username and password, display all the data of a specific student, display the wanted data, configure the GPA of the student if any of the data of the his/her course data is changed, configure the student contact details that is already saved in the database, add any new payment that has been done, configure any course details, and sort the students according to their GPAs.
___
- The repository includes:
  1. Full registration system built in c++ and a flowchart (but the flowchart does not implement all the functions available in the c++ code).
  2. A full documentation of the project for both the c++ code and flowcahrt.
